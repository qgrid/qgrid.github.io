- [How to detect if something was changed in the model?](#Ñ€ow-to-detect-if-something-was-changed-in-the-model)

The most of work could be configured in the HTML templates but sometimes it's required to have direct access to the `model` - a state container of the q-grid.

```typescript
import { Grid, GridModel } from 'ng2-qgrid';

@Component({
   selector: 'my-component',
   template: '<q-grid [model]="gridModel"></q-grid>',
})
export class MyComponent implements AfterViewInit {
   gridModel = this.qgrid.model();

   constructor(private qgrid: Grid) {}

   ngAfterViewInit() {
      const firstRow = this.gridModel.data().rows[0];

      this.gridModel.selection({
         unit: 'row',
         items: [firstRow]
      });
   }
}
```

> q-grid state implements immutable pattern so to change the state new value or reference should be created in other case nothing will happen.

   How to detect if something was changed in the model?
</a>

All separate states in the model have `<name-of-state>Changed` property to handle model modifications. There are two methods for changes subscription.

* `on` is used to get change notifications.
* `watch` is used to get first notification if something was changed before subscription and then get change notifications.

```typescript
@Component({
   selector: 'my-component',
   template: '<q-grid [model]="gridModel"></q-grid>'
})
export class MyComponent implements AfterViewInit {
   gridModel = this.qgrid.model();

   constructor(private qgrid: Grid) {}

   ngAfterViewInit() {
      this.gridModel.selectionChanged.on(e => console.log('selection changed')));
   }
}
```

> q-grid uses own event system that not guarantee that event is triggered in angular zone, so there can be situations that change detection should be triggered manually inside a subscription.
